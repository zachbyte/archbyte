To confirm that the Arch Linux ISO you downloaded is valid and not corrupted, you can verify its integrity and authenticity using checksums and PGP signatures. Here's how you can do it inside your Arch Linux installation:

### 1. **Download the ISO and Signature Files:**
Ensure you have both the Arch Linux ISO and the `.sig` signature file that accompanies it.

For example:
- ISO file: `archlinux-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso`
- Signature file: `archlinux-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso.sig`

If you don't have the signature file, you can download it from the [Arch Linux download page](https://archlinux.org/download/).

### 2. **Import the Arch Linux PGP Keyring:**
You need to import the PGP key used by the Arch Linux developers to sign the ISO. Run the following command to import the keys:

```bash
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
```

This will ensure your keyring is up to date with trusted Arch Linux PGP keys.

### 3. **Verify the ISO Signature:**
Run the following `gpg` command to verify the ISO file using the signature file:

```bash
gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso.sig
```

- Replace `archlinux-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso` with the actual filename of the ISO.
- If the output includes a message like `Good signature from "Arch Linux Release Engineering <releng@archlinux.org>"`, then the ISO is valid.

### 4. **Verify the ISO Checksum (Optional):**
You can also compare the checksum of the downloaded ISO to the checksum provided on the Arch Linux download page.

1. Get the checksum of the ISO file:

```bash
sha256sum archlinux-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso
```

2. Compare the output to the checksum provided on the official Arch Linux website. If they match, your ISO is not corrupted.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that the Arch Linux ISO is both authentic and uncorrupted.
